    <h3 class="heading">* Note that this means:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The order of server depends on the score odd or even same as in singles.</li>
        <li>The service courts are changed by the servicing side only when a point is scored. In all other cases, the players continue to stay in their respective service court from where they played previous rally. This shall guarantee alternate server.</li>
